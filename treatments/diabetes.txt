The major goal in treating type 1 and type 2 diabetes is to control blood sugar (glucose) levels within the normal range, with minimal excursions to low or high levels.

Type 1 diabetes is treated with:

insulin,
exercise, and a
type 1 diabetes diet.
Type 2 diabetes is treated:

First with weight reduction, a type 2 diabetes diet, and exercise
Diabetes medications (oral or injected) are prescribed when these measures fail to control the elevated blood sugars of type 2 diabetes.
If other medications become ineffective treatment with insulin may be initiated.
